# Countries (REST API)

## Introduction

This is a [FrontendMentor.io]() coding challenge, where I was provided with a design and my job was to get it looking as close to that design as possible.

The used this challenge to test my ability in working with a REST API and practice handling JavaScipt promises.

Visitors of this Web app are able to:

- view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.

- See all countries from the API on the homepage.

- Search for a country using an input field.

- Filter countries by region.

- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page.

- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode.

## Lessons Learned

- I am Know very comfortable working with API, interm of fetching for data and handling promises using JavaScript and React library.

- This Challenge helped me get a good grasp about the way React work, which was a confusing concept for me before venturing into this coding challenge.

- This was my first attempt at deploying a website into a hosting service ([vercel](https://vercel.com)), usually I only deployed my projects into gh-pages.
